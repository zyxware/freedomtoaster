<displayname>Ubuntu 9.10 Live (CD)</displayname>
<description>Ubuntu is a widely used Linux distribution predominantly targeted at desktop users. It concentrates on usability, ease of installation, and working 'out of the box'.</description>
<longdescription>This is the "Standard" Ubuntu desktop release which uses the Gnome Desktop Environment. Although support is quite good for all Ubuntu products and variations, this is the best supported.

Ubuntu is a complete operating system for your computer, and is often used instead of Microsoft Windows because Ubuntu:

   1. Can cost hundreds of dollars less.
   2. Has virtually no spyware or virus issues.
   3. Can still run on older computers where newer versions of Microsoft Windows won't.
   4. Has free and paid support available.

A lot of other software can be downloaded automatically from the web (using Synaptic).

Ubuntu is sponsored by Canonical Ltd., a private company founded by South African entrepreneur Mark Shuttleworth.</longdescription>
